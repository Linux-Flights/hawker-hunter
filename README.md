# Hawker Hunter
Hawker Hunter aircraft addon for Flightgear.

## History
Developed during the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the Hawker Hawker P1067 Hunter is a transonic British jet aircraft and is a story of numerous trials and developments, many abandoned before reaching anywhere near the production stage.
 
Following the end of World War II, Hawker recognised that jet-propulsion was the future of military aircraft development and Hawker Siddeley  Chief Designer Sydney Camm initially proposed the P.1040 to the RAF. Unfortunately, the RAF took little interest in the design, seeking better performance and ability so Camm turned his attention to transforming the Hawker Fury / Sea Fury into a jet-powered, carrier-based fighter for the Fleet Air Arm and thus emerged was the P.1035 Hawk (also known as the Jet Fury). 
 
However, when the Air Ministry issued Specification E38/46 Camm set about developing the Sea Hawk, replacing the straight wing with a-35 degree swept wing, categorising the aircraft Hawker P.1052.
 
During its first flight during 1948, the P.1052 first prototype demonstrated good performance and despite carrying out several successful Carrier Trials, it was agreed that it did not warrant further development into a production aircraft.
 
Undeterred, Hawker Siddeley converted the second P.1052 prototype as a ‘private venture’, redesignated as the Hawker P.1081, featuring swept tail-planes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear.
